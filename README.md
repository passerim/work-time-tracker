# Work Time Tracker

Work Time Tracker is a minimal web application for tracking work hours with daily timestamps and progress visualization. The project is implemented with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses Bootstrap 5 for the user interface. All logic runs client-side, with no backend.

## Features
- Add, view, and reset daily work timestamps (in/out)
- Visual progress bar for tracked work time
- Responsive and accessible UI using Bootstrap 5
- Data persistence via browser localStorage (no server required)
- Automated build with linting and minification (JS/CSS)
- Bilingual support (English/Italian)
- No backend, only static files

## Architecture
- The app is a single-page application (SPA) with all logic in `script.js`.
- User interactions (form submit, reset, reload) are handled via event listeners in `script.js`.
- Timestamps and state are stored in `localStorage` for persistence across reloads.
- The progress bar and table are dynamically updated based on user input.
- No server communication or API integration.

The automated build copies and minifies files from `src/` to `dist/` and publishes only the optimized files to GitHub Pages.
